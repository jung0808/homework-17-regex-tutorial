# Regex Tutorial Homework 17.

## Introductory paragraph

This is my homework-17 writing about Regex expressions.  
I had an option of choosing between: Matching a hex value, Matching an email, Matching a URL, matching an HTML tag.  
I have decided to explain and give tutorials on how to match an Email address using Regular expression.

## Summary

According to MDN, "Regular expressions are patterns used to match character combination in strings. In JavaScript, regular expressions are also objects. These pattersn are used with the exec() and test() methods of RegExp, and witht he match(), matchAll(), replace(), replaceAll(), search(), and split() methods of String.

Email matching regex. This is what I'll be using to do this HW.

`Matching an Email: /^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/`
